## About
Eso-Ess allows users to input a request for help during recovery efforts after a disaster.
The help request is logged in our database with the user's location.
The location of the help request is placed on a map to give relief distributors a visual representation of the areas that are still in need of assistance.

The app also features an "administrative" side that lets you update the status of each individual help request.

## Technologies Used:
#### - Node.js
#### - Express.js
#### - Handlebars
#### - Google Geolocation API
#### - Sequelize
#### - Twitter Account Post Retrieval

## Future Additions/Updates
  * User Authentication
  * More Administrator Capabilities
  * Methods for retrieving help requests  while offline
  * More robust map filtering/displays
  * Analytic resources for relief providers
  * More complicated data structures to give relief providers clearer information
